Generalized heap implementation

Generalized heap is based on usual heap data structure -
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29 .

It provides two additional paremeters, which allow optimizing heap
for particular cases:

* Fanout. The number of children per each heap node.
  * Fanout=1 corresponds to usual List data structure.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28computing%29 .
  * Fanout=2 corresponds to usual Binary heap.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap .
  * Fanout>2 corresponds to D-heap. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-heap .
    D-heap can be faster than Binary heap in the following cases:
    * If item comparison is faster than item assignment.
    * If sequential access to items is faster than non-sequential access
      to items.
    * If the number of 'decrease key' operations is larger than the number
      of 'pop heap' operations for min-heap. This is usually the case
      for Dijkstra algorithm
      ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm ).

* PageChunks. The number of chunks per each heap page. Each chunk contains
  Fanout children, so each heap page contains (PageChunks * Fanout) items.
  Items inside heap page are organized in a sub-heap with a root item outside
  the page. Items in the page can be roots pointing to another pages.
  * PageChunks=1 corresponds to standard heap.
  * PageChunks>1 corresponds to B-heap. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-heap.
    Heap pages containing more than one page chunk can be useful if multiple
    item accesses inside heap page is faster than multiple accesses to items
    across distinct heap pages. This can be the case for systems with virtual
    memory, where VM pages can be swapped out to slow media.
    Heap pages can be mapped to VM pages if PageChunks is calculated using
    the following formula:
    * PageChunks = sizeof(VM_page) / (sizeof(item) * Fanout)
    Perfrect alginment between VM pages and heap pages can be achieved if
    heap's root item is placed at the end of VM page. In this case the first
    child of the heap's root (i.e. the item with index 1) sits at the beginning
    of the next VM page.


===============================================================================
The implementation provides the following functions:
* Auxiliary functions:
  * restore_heap_after_item_increase() - restores max heap invariant after
    the item's value increase.
  * restore_heap_after_item_decrease() - restores max heap invariant after
    the item's value decrease.
  * remove_from_heap() - removes the given item from the heap.
  * nway_merge() - performs N-way merge on top of the heap.

* STL-like functions:
  * is_heap_until() - returns an iterator to the first non-heap item
    in the given range.
  * is_heap() - checks whether the given range contains valid heap.
  * make_heap() - creates a heap.
  * push_heap() - pushes the last element in the range to the heap.
  * pop_heap() - pops up the maximum element from the heap.
  * sort_heap() - sorts heap items in ascending order.


The implementation is inspired by http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327 ,
but it is more generalized. The implementation is optimized for speed.
There are the following files:
* gheap_cpp03.hpp - gheap optimized for C++03.
* gheap_cpp11.hpp - gheap optimized for C++11.
* gheap.hpp - switch file, which includes either gheap_cpp03.hpp
  or gheap_cpp11.hpp depending on whether GHEAP_CPP11 macro is defined.
* gheap.h - gheap optimized for C99.
* gpriority_queue.hpp - priority queue on top of gheap for C++.
* gpriority_queue.h - priority queue on top of gheap for C.

Don't forget passing -DNDEBUG option to the compiler when creating optimized
builds. This significantly speeds up gheap code by removing debug assertions.
